# cmm

Tool to create client mini maps from terrain and buildings. It supports up to
four layers.

This program is similar to `hmerge`. The difference is, layers have a base color
and the height values brightens or darkens this base color. All layers are added
to the final color.

IMPORTANT: Sources for all layers should have the same size, width, height, number of values.
