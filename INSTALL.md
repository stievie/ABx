# Install and run

All binaries of the *Server* are located in `./bin`.

The binary of the *Client* is located in `./abclient/bin` and has the name
`fw`, `fw_d` (Debug), `fw.exe` (Windows) or `fw_d.exe` (Windows Debug).

## Server

1. Build the server, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md). After that all server executables are located in the `bin` directory.
2. On Windows copy the *OpenSSL* and *PostgreSQL* client libraries to the `bin` directory.
    * `libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll` (OpenSSL)
    * `libssl-1_1-x64.dll` (OpenSSL)
    * `libiconv-2.dll` (PostgreSQL)
    * `libintl-9.dll` (PostgreSQL)
    * `libpq.dll` (PostgreSQL)
    * `libwinpthread-1.dll` (PostgreSQL)
    * Depending on your PostgreSQL version it may also require `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll`
3. [Setup a PosgreSQL server](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL)
4. Create a `db_private.lua` file in `bin/config` directory to enter the DB configuration, example:
~~~lua
-- Postgres
db_host = "database.host"
db_port = 5432
db_user = "user"
db_pass = "password"
~~~
5. Create a database with the name `forgottenwars`.
~~~sh
$ createdb forgottenwars
~~~
6. Run `./bin/dbtool update` to create the database structure. Then run `./bin/dbtool updateskills` to update the Skills table. If the DB is empty, `dbtool` emits *one* error, you can ignore this.
(you may try to run `./dbtool update` under the folder `bin`, if you get error like this: `db.lua:18: module 'config/db_private' not found`, on ubuntu 20.04)
2. Download client assets `client_data.7z` and `sound_data.7z` from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ajy_fJI3BLBobOAOXZ47wtBgdBg) and put them into the clients `abclient/bin` directory (don't replace existing files). There should also be the Urho3D asset files, this directory should look like:
~~~plain
bin
  - AbData
  - Autoload
  - CoreData
  - Data
  - SoundData
~~~
8. Run `genassets.bat` (Windows) or `genassets.sh` (Linux) in the `bin` directory to generate the server assets from the client assets. This may take some time.
9. Run the `./bin/keygen` tool to create the DH server keys.
10. Run `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.crt` in the `bin` directory to create self-signed keys and certificate for the HTTPS file server.
11. Run `run.bat` or `./run` in the root directory, which runs all required services in the correct order.
12. You may want to create an account key to be able to create an account. To do so, run the `dbtool`:
~~~sh
$ ./bin/dbtool genacckey
~~~

To stop the servers in the correct order, you can use `./stop` in the root directory.

### Running

If you are behind a router and want that your friend can connect to your server running on your hardware, you must open the following ports:

1. TCP/UDP 2748: Login server
2. TCP 2749: Game server
3. TCP 8081: File server

This assumes you have the default configuration. You can change the ports in the respective configuration files:

1. `bin/ablogin.lua`: `login_port`
2. `bin/abserv.lua`: `base_port` or `game_port`
3. `bin/abfile.lua`: `file_port`

### Autoupdate

To automatically update game asset files by the client, follow the following steps:

1. Pack the asset files into compressed Urho3D .pak files with Urho3Ds PackageTool with running `Setup\createpak.bat`, or use Urho3D's `PackageTool` directly, type in the `abclient/bin` directory:
~~~plain
PackageTool CoreData\ CoreData.pak -c
PackageTool Data\ Data.pak -c
PackageTool Autoload\ Autoload.pak -c
PackageTool AbData\ AbData.pak -c
PackageTool SoundData\ SoundData.pak -c
~~~
2. Copy the resulting .pak files to the file servers root directory, usually `bin/file_root`.
3. Run `fhash` in that directory, e.g. when your are in `bin`: `fhash file_root`. This will create two files for each file found in this directory: (1) (filename).meta: File partitions, and (2) (filename).sha1: overall SHA1 hash of the file.

This will cause the client to check for updated files every time it starts, and binary
patches changed files. This works best with large files.

To compile the client without autoupdating, define `NO_AUTOUPDATE`, CMake option
`ABX_CLIENT_NO_AUTOUPDATE`.

#### Compression

Sadly the file server does not support compression by its own.

Since the Urho3D PackageTool compresses file individually, single changed files
do not change the entire package file, so the updater can just replace the changed
block and doesn't have to replace the whole file. This means you can and should
enable compression when calling the package tool with the `-c` switch.

#### Executables

If you put also the client executables (`fw`, `abupdate`) in the `file_root` directory,
also these will be updated. To make this work for Windows and different Linux distributions,
there must be a subdirectory for each platform you want to support in the `file_root`
directory:

~~~plain
file_root/
  - AbData.{pak,meta,sha1}
  - Autoload.{pak,meta,sha1}
  - CoreData.{pak,meta,sha1}
  - Data.{pak,meta,sha1}
  - SoundData.{pak,meta,sha1}
  - windows/
    - fw.exe
    - abupdate.exe
  - arch/
    - fw
    - abupdate
  - manjaro/
    - fw
    - abupdate
  - debian/
    - fw
    - abupdate
  - ...
~~~

On Linux the updater uses `/etc/os-release` to find out which distribution it is running on.
To find out what's your distribution, you could run:
~~~sh
$ awk -F= '$1=="ID" { print $2 ;}' /etc/os-release
~~~

Every time you deploy an update, replace the `.pak` files and executables with the
new versions, and re-run `../fhash -R` in this directory.

### Known issues

The Server should run on Windows and Linux.

## Client

1. Build it, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md). The client executable is located in the `abclient/bin` directory and has the name `fw` or `fw.exe` on Windows.
2. On Windows copy the required libraries to the `abclient/bin` directory:
    * `d3dcompiler_47.dll`
    * `libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll` (OpenSSL)
    * `libssl-1_1-x64.dll` (OpenSSL)
3. Copy the configuration file for the Game client from `abclient/Setup/config.xml` to `abclient/bin/config.xml` and enter the Host and Port of the Login server:
~~~xml
<!-- Example when your run the server and client on the same machine -->
<config>
  <parameter name="LoginHost" type="string" value="localhost" />
  <parameter name="LoginPort" type="int" value="2748" />
</config>
~~~
4. Run `fw.exe` in `abclient/bin`. `$ cd abclient/bin && ./fw`.
5. Create an account using the UUID of your previously created account key. To find out what GUID was created, run the `dbtool`. This lists all account keys, pick one:
~~~sh
$ ./bin/dbtool acckeys
~~~
6. After creating an account, you may want to give your account all privileges. You can do that with the `dbtool`:
~~~sh
$ ./bin/dbtool makegod -user my_username
~~~

NOTE: Whenever you run `dbtool` the server must not run.

### Known issues

Nothing special so far.
